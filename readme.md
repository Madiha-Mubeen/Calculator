## Scientific/Enigneering Calculator 

An easy to use, good looking calculator built with **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript ** . This website also include custom favicon, **Dark/Light theme toggle **, responsiveness, and indicator for active operations.

## Features I have used :
- Functional & Basics Mathematics button
- Custom Favicon
- Styled UI with hover effects !
- Responsiveness added through media queries
- Mobile-friendly layout

## Languages Implied:
<b>HTML <br> CSS <br> JavaScript<b>

## Difficulties faced/Level:
It was kind of hard while adding buttons, where should I add certain buttons, which kind of buttons are useful for the users. Secondly While doing CSS for layout of the container and color-theme to choose, especially for dark theme ! Had fun while working on this project :)
